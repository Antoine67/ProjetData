AUTOMATIC            	    Lets the solver select the metaheuristic.
GREEDY_DESCENT      	  	Accepts improving (cost-reducing) local search neighbors until a local minimum is reached.
GUIDED_LOCAL_SEARCH 	  	Uses guided local search to escape local minima (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_Local_Search); this is generally the most efficient metaheuristic for vehicle routing.
SIMULATED_ANNEALING 	  	Uses simulated annealing to escape local minima (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).
TABU_SEARCH         	  	Uses tabu search to escape local minima (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search).
OBJECTIVE_TABU_SEARCH   	Uses tabu search on the objective value of solution to escape local minima
